At the time of buying this it was quite a big gamble to take. I had accumulated a lot of hardware that I was managing to run via MIDI for sync and notes but the addition of devices with quite a bit of reliance on CV + Gate was limiting options as to which devices or combination of devices I could run at once. All of this also required the computer to be powered on. Already using an Arturia Keystep I traded it up for the Keystep Pro, especially as the black version was heavily discounted on one online store. I was not disappointed.
