Title based on a subtitle from the game Destiny 2, attempting to activate something but the player has insufficient vestiges of dread.

This was made around about the time I got access to the Red suite of VSTs, possibly when I got the Focusrite audio interface. There are Red compressors and Red EQs on everything.

Generally whenever I am recording hardware devices that are CV & gate oriented I will use the Arturia KeystepPro to sync up to Reason. Patterns programmed on the Arturia KeystepPro will drive the CV, gate, and curve inputs of the device and the audio of a performance is captured into Reason.

The Moog Werkstatt-01 & CV Expander on this is driven by a pattern on the Arturia KeystepPro which also has a curve value in the pattern affecting the filter. This was recorded into Reason, which is in sync with the Keystep, and I twiddled with the knobs on the werkstatt. I have no record of how the werkstatt was set up. At this point I had nothing else going on, just this little pattern. I recorded about 6 minutes of  it.

I decided to use Reason Studios Redrum for the drums just to create a set of limits. There are no options for step probability or individual track length and timing for instance. However I ended up creating a bit of a nightmare tangle of cables and devices with compressors and EQs so I will have to revisit this and work out what the hell I was thinking at the time

I wanted to put something trancey over the top so I reached for Rob Papen Predator RE. I keep forgetting I own this device, I should use it more often. Turned out the default patch that loaded did exactly what I was imagining so I didn't even bother trying to create an original sound. I used Reason Studio Scales & Chords to derive chords from single notes on the keyboard.

Because it was coming together very quickly and I would have been too much of an interruption to wire up and program a 303 style hardware device I used  Audiorealism abl2 to get an idea down, but also complicated this by adding an Audiorealism abl3.
