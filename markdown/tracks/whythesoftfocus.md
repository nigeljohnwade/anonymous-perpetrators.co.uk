Title is a snippet of chat during Lockdown Zoom Poker.

File creation date is 19th November 2021 for the first Reason 12 file. There's a new Reason 12 file created on 8th December, 2021 in a different directory, so I guess that was probably just a reorganisation artifact. At the time of writing I have moved it over to Reason 13. 

I can't remember if the Moog Werkstatt was gate triggered by a device that could receive MIDI and output Gate, or if it is just a freeform VCA LFO in square mode. This was the starting point though. I had not long had the Werkstatt and was spending a lot of time playing with it to learn how to use it.

I also can't really remember much about the TB-3 pattern or voice, but the track laid down is not being sent to anything else in Reason so the effects are all direct from the TB-3.

All the other voices come Native Instruments Twenty Five instrument for Kontakt (7). I guess this had just been released at the time I was making the track so it was something new to play with.

At this point in time I was using Umpf drum machines in reason quite a bit. The drum samples are probably from Sample From Mars. 909 kicks and 606 hats is all that there is, quite sparse. There are some polymeters on individual hi hat voices in the pattern, some variance of looping and pendulum, and quite a bit of randomness as well.

Dual Arpeggio must have been on trial as the MIDI is printed. I currently have access it to the device through the Reason+ subscription service.

Revisiting it 3 years later it is quite badly mixed and the project is a bit of a mess as well so I have tidied it up and I will try and give it a better mix and master. 

I had a bit of a problem with the Kontakt plug-in as there are now three of these: Kontakt, Kontakt 7 & Kontakt 8. I had to replace the Kontakt plugins and I chose Kontakt 7 plugins to get access to Twenty Five. The pack does however also appear in Kontakt 8 so maybe I will change them again at a future date. If I had adjusted parameters on any of the Twenty Five voices than that information has been lost.
