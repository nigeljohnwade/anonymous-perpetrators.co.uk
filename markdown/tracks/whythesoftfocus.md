Title is a snippet of chat during Lockdown Zoom Poker.

I can't remember if the Moog Werkstatt was gate triggered by a device that could receive MIDI and output Gate, or if it is just a freeform VCA LFO in square mode. This was the starting point though. I had not long had the Werkstatt and was spending a lot of time playing with it to learn how to use it.

I also can't really remember much about the TB-3 pattern or voice, but the track laid down is not being sent to anything else in Reason so the effects are all direct from the TB-3.

All the other voices come Native Instruments Twenty Five instrument for Kontakt. I guess this had just been released at the time I was making the track so it was something new to play with.

At this point in time I was using Umpf drum machines in reason quite a bit. The drum samples are probably from Sample From Mars. 909 kicks and 606 hats is all that there is, quite sparse. There are some polymeters on individual hi hat voices in the pattern, some variance of looping and pendulum, and quite a bit of randomness as well.
