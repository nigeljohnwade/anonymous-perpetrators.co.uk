I dedicated some time to learning how to use the Chord Sequencer player device in Reason, as I haven't really got to grips with that device. I am not sure I have fully understood what it can do, I have just used it as a guide to pick chords with a single key. They are definitely not chords I would have known to choose. The guidance and immediacy of the access to useful chord progressions was great help. 
I decided to use a 909 kit in Kong rather than my usual 707 Jackbox. This turned out to be more difficult than I expected as Kong did not function in the way I wanted. Pads directed to a specific output did not get removed from the main mix output. I worked around it but it seemed like a major flaw.
