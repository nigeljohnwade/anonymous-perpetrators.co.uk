Title is a snippet of chat during Lockdown Zoom Poker.

File creation date is 3rd November, 2022 for the first Reason 12 file I can find, but it also has a modified date of 1st November, 2022. It might have been started earlier in a different file that I can't locate.. At the time of writing I have moved it over to Reason 13. 

Something laid back and trippy, going to great extremes with the Drum Map player.

First time use recording the Roland Boutique TB-03, which I picked up reasonably priced second hand from Reverb. I was keen to have another hardware 303 style device to see what it was like using both at the same time but I have only ever used one or the other. This one is a bit more like an actual TB-303 compared to the TB-3.

First recording of the Moog Mavis as well. Not sure if I ever documented the patch but it's just a drone as far as I can tell. Probably recorded this first.

I think the Europa patch 5th Elemental has been modified so I will have to check this and save it off as a new patch if it is.
