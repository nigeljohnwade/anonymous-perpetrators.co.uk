The main line for this came from having an experiment with Lectric Panda Evolution. 
I am a big fan of this type of device. 
The pattern created from the generative device was rendered out to MIDI so that I could chop it up, add or remove notes, or rescale the timing as I saw fit.

At the time I was considering buyig either Synapse The Legend or Blamsoft Viking Synthesizer VK-2 as rack extensions so I added them both to my monthly subscription to get a grip with them and make a decision. 
Being able to create many instances of these devices and feed their note input from slightly differing versions of the main line created by the Lectric Panda Evolution. 
This resulted in many variations but in the end there are two Synapse The Legend instances and one Blamsoft Viking Synthesizer VK-2, and they are fed in to a shimmerverb in the form of Jiggery-Pokery Sound The Animus. 
It's a pretty massive sound altogether.

The drums are from a quick play around on the Korg Volca Beats with a fairly simple set of patterns that were already there chopped up to remove errors and create sensible sections of the same length.
