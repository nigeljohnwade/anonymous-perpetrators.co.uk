Title is a snippet of chat during Lockdown Zoom Poker.

File creation date is 31st August, 2021 for the first Reason 12 file. There's a new Reason 12 file created on 5th December, 2022 in a different directory, so I guess that was probably just a reorganisation artifact. At the time of writing I have moved it over to Reason 13. 

Werkstatt must be synced up to MIDI out from Reason as it's definitely playing a sequence rather than a drone. Most likely via a volca as I didn't have the KeystepPro at this point but the track also features the Microbrute so it may have been routed through that. I might also have been patching outs from the Microbrute into the Werkstatt. It's a very plain languid arpeggio over the same three notes throughout with a bit of knob tweaking. There are no edits to the recording.

Europa is playing the same three note arpeggio on the Friendly Keys preset (such a good preset). There are some automation to Amp Decay and Amp Release over the course of the piece.

Microbrute has been triggered by MIDI from Reason and the output recorded as an audio track.

Polysix is playing the same MIDI notes as the Microbrute and using a similar complementary patch.
