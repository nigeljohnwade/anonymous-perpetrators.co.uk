        "Description": "This was quite an early Roland Aira TB-3 track. It even uses a pair of chained stock patterns.\\nI think it also one of the first tracks recorded after starting to use Reason Studios umpf drum modules. I was also started to get into Reason Studios Drum Sequencer a lot, taking as much advantage of the step probability, the individual track speed, the individual track length, and individual track mute automation to create a kind continuous variation feel to the main rythmn.\\nThe sound from the Kork microKORG is one the factory presets. It is not MIDI sequenced, it is an audio recording of a performance. It's not the most complicated set of notes but, they are a set of notes which sound quite powerful and driving. The recording required quite a bit of editing for minor timing mistakes but I felt that was easier than trying to do more takes trying to get it right.\\nThere's a sample from a public domain source which I forget that has been used as the source of a trio of Reason Studions Grain Sample Manipulator and manipulated beyond recognition.",
