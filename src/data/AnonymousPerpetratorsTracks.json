        "Description": "This was quite an early Roland Aira TB-3 track. It even uses a pair of chained stock patterns.\\nI think it also one of the first tracks recorded after starting to use Reason Studios umpf drum modules. I was also started to get into Reason Studios Drum Sequencer a lot, taking as much advantage of the step probability, the individual track speed, the individual track length, and individual track mute automation to create a kind continuous variation feel to the main rythmn.\\nThe sound from the Kork microKORG is one the factory presets. It is not MIDI sequenced, it is an audio recording of a performance. It's not the most complicated set of notes but, they are a set of notes which sound quite powerful and driving. The recording required quite a bit of editing for minor timing mistakes but I felt that was easier than trying to do more takes trying to get it right.\\nThere's a sample from a public domain source which I forget that has been used as the source of a trio of Reason Studions Grain Sample Manipulator and manipulated beyond recognition.",

        "Description": "Generally whenever I am recording hardware devices that are CV & gate oriented I will use the Arturia Keystep Pro to sync up to Reason. Patterns programmed on the Arturia Keystep Pro will drive the CV, gate, and curve inputs of the device and the audio of a performance is captured. The Moog Werkstatt-01 & CV Expander on this is driven by a pattern on the Arturia Keystep Pro which also has a curve value in the pattern affecting the filter.\\nI decided to use Reason Studios Redrum for the drums just to create a set of limits. There are no options for step probability or individual track length and timing for instance.\\nI wanted to put something trancey over the top so I reached for Rob Papen Predator RE. Turned out the default patch that loaded did exactly what I was imagining so I didn't even bother trying to create an original sound. I used Reason Studio Scales & Chords to derive chords from single notes on the keyboard.\\nBecause it was coming together very quickly and I would have been too much of an interruption to wire up and prgram a 303 style hardware device I used  Audiorealism abl2 to get the idea down.\\n",
