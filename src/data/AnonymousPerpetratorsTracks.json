        "Description": "This was the first track I recorded using the Korg Volca Beats. After buying it I had played around with it, taking it on buses and trains and enjoying playing around with beats on the move without having to think about fitting them to anything else. I recorded about 15 minutes of performance with the Korg Volca Beats as a base for the track.\\nI forget now whether the pattern on the Roland Aira TB-3 is one the stock patterns or one I programmed, but that came second. I chopped up the best bits of the drums and with a bit of copying and pasting created a large amount of space to record into. I recorded one take of Roland Aira TB-3, after several practice runs, and ended up using it in its entirety.\\nThere were a few experiments after that trying to find something that worked over the top, settling on a very simple set of notes (root, minor third, fifth) on the Blamsoft Viking Synthesizer using a suitably resonant sweeping boing sound.\\nFeeling that it lacked enough low frequncies I copied the note track from the Blamsoft Viking Synthesizer and fed them into New Fangled Audio's Pendulate and created a nasty, deep, throaty growl kind of a drone.",

        "Description": "The main line for this came from having an experiment with Lectric Panda Evolution. I am a big fan of this type of device. The pattern created from the generative device was rendered out to MIDI so that I could chop it up, add or remove notes, or rescale the timing as I saw fit.\\nAt the time I was considering buyig either Synapse The Legend or Blamsoft Viking Synthesizer VK-2 as rack extensions so I added them both to my monthly subscription to get a grip with them and make a decision. Being able to create many instances of these devices and feed their note input from slightly differing versions of the main line created by the Lectric Panda Evolution. This resulted in many variations but in the end there are two Synapse The Legend instances and one Blamsoft Viking Synthesizer VK-2, and they are fed in to a shimmerverb in the form of Jiggery-Pokery Sound The Animus. It's a pretty massive sound altogether.\\nThe drums are from a quick play around on the Korg Volca Beats with a fairly simple set of patterns that were already there chopped up to remove errors and create sensible sections of the same length.",

        "Description": "This was quite an early Roland Aira TB-3 track. It even uses a pair of chained stock patterns.\\nI think it also one of the first tracks recorded after starting to use Reason Studios umpf drum modules. I was also started to get into Reason Studios Drum Sequencer a lot, taking as much advantage of the step probability, the individual track speed, the individual track length, and individual track mute automation to create a kind continuous variation feel to the main rythmn.\\nThe sound from the Kork microKORG is one the factory presets. It is not MIDI sequenced, it is an audio recording of a performance. It's not the most complicated set of notes but, they are a set of notes which sound quite powerful and driving. The recording required quite a bit of editing for minor timing mistakes but I felt that was easier than trying to do more takes trying to get it right.\\nThere's a sample from a public domain source which I forget that has been used as the source of a trio of Reason Studions Grain Sample Manipulator and manipulated beyond recognition.",

        "Description": "Generally whenever I am recording hardware devices that are CV & gate oriented I will use the Arturia Keystep Pro to sync up to Reason. Patterns programmed on the Arturia Keystep Pro will drive the CV, gate, and curve inputs of the device and the audio of a performance is captured. The Moog Werkstatt-01 & CV Expander on this is driven by a pattern on the Arturia Keystep Pro which also has a curve value in the pattern affecting the filter.\\nI decided to use Reason Studios Redrum for the drums just to create a set of limits. There are no options for step probability or individual track length and timing for instance.\\nI wanted to put something trancey over the top so I reached for Rob Papen Predator RE. Turned out the default patch that loaded did exactly what I was imagining so I didn't even bother trying to create an original sound. I used Reason Studio Scales & Chords to derive chords from single notes on the keyboard.\\nBecause it was coming together very quickly and I would have been too much of an interruption to wire up and prgram a 303 style hardware device I used  Audiorealism abl2 to get the idea down.\\n",
